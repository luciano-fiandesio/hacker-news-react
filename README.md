An excellent resource for learning React is [Robin Wieruch](https://twitter.com/rwieruch)'s book "[The Road to Learn React](http://leanpub.com/the-road-to-learn-react)".

This repo contains the code for the application used in the book for explaining React concepts.
The app is a simple [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) clone, that uses the actual HN's [API](https://hn.algolia.com/api) to fetch real data.
